# Unreasonably Advanced Calculator
The actual point of this repo is to make the most unreasonably useless calculator possible

## Why?
This is a very big question a lot of you may ask and my answer to you is, I don't know. This app was made because I was bored and couldn't think of anything useful to do. Never though I would get here but look at me now!

## How To Run?
In order to run this app you have to install the `colorama` package. To do this, you have to enter the `pip install colorama` python command in a python terminal window. For example, on my computer I would have to use the following command `py -m pip install colorama`. I don't know if it will be the same for you guys but that is what I can say to help you from my experience...  

I hope you enjoy this worthless program that does nothing to help the human mind what so ever!
